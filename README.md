# Rig-Out
Deciding an outfit is a task that every person in the world takes part in each and every day. A person’s outfit is an important choice as it allows the individual to represent their personality and identity physically through their appearance. However, deciding what to wear every day can be overwhelming and time-consuming. 

Rig-out is an app that will provide users a way to pick out their outfits more efficiently and with better results stylistically. The app will provide users with an outfit every single day based on a wide variety of factors and allow them to choose outfits they like and do not. With Rig-out, we intend to make a more stylistic and hassle-free world.
